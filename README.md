# FaceLink

***This software is incomplete and barely-functional***

Basically:

* Wrote a standalone program to wire the experimental Steam Link face tracking OSC from a Quest Pro to VRChat avatar parameters for Unified Expressions face tracking.
* Ported OscCore - doing a quick and dirty job - to netstandard2.1 *without* Unity.
* Didn't feel like reimplementing the rest of the owl. Sorry :)

This is probably useful for a quick and dirty documentation of the OSC parameters that are sent, which is why I'm publishing it rather than deleting it.
